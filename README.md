## Getting Started

###Motivation
The motivation for this project was to have a way in which the static files used for the education package can be tracked on git on a user friendly interface and to have to ability to generate a static website based on the static files available.



### Prerequisities and Installations

-Python (if using ubuntu python is already installed)
-Pip instructions here -> https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/
-virtualenv (Optional , but recommended), create a virtual environment for running the app

```
#run this in the cmd/terminal
$ sudo pip install virtualenv

#create the environment with
$sudo virtualenv venv

#venv is the name of the folder that will have your python interpreter

#activate the environment with 
$ sudo source venv/bin/activate


#to deactivate it later on when done use
$ deactivate

```

In the virtual environment install all dependancies with :

---
#run this in the cmd/terminal
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
---
